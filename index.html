            Space exploration has been a growing field and conversation for the past century, so many new
            discoveries
            made in such little time.
            First moon landing in 1969, now in 2023 there is a preparation of the next moon landing and trying to
            gather
            as much information/materials as possible in a limited time.
            Since 1969, so much new technology has been invented to help make <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA">NASA</a> team jobs easier. <strong class="text-success fw-bold"><i class="bi-hand-thumbs-up"></i>It also opens the possibility
            of
            finding certain materials use as survival and
            may lead to findings of <em>extraterrestrial life.</em></strong>

                <p class="lead"> The University of Maryland team developed an instrument to help identify compositions
                    of materials
                    and
                    also

                    The device contains traviolet laser the helps remove small amounts of material from samples.
                    It has the same features and benefits as its older versions and only weights 17 pounds and not as
                    much power is needed. One of the benefits of such device is that the laser does not destroy parts of
                    the sample,
                    It is very delicate that once tested on ice it was still able to analyize and figure out its
                    composition, as well as high mass resolution. During the next years the Orbitrap will be used into
                    other planets and
                    the moon in the next missions NASA has next. <strong class="text-decoration-underline fw-normal">The Orbitrap is a new device opening the door for
                    greater inventions for geochemistry and
                    astrobiology that may lead to finding signs of life as well as planet materials.</strong></p>
